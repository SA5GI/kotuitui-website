Kōtuitui: An Interactive Campaign Website

Project Overview
This is a one-page informational website developed for the "Kōtuitui" campaign for Auckland Transport (AT).

The primary goal of the website is to introduce the Kōtuitui campaign, which aims to foster a stronger sense of community and safety on public transport by allowing passengers to recognize and reward drivers for positive experiences through a digital badge system.

Key Features
Single-Page Architecture: All content is presented on a single, continuously scrolling page to provide a seamless and uninterrupted user experience.

Interactive Scrolling: The primary navigation links animate the viewport to the relevant sections of the page with a smooth, controlled scroll.

Dynamic Header: The navigation bar is designed to be interactive, sliding out of view on downward scroll to maximize screen real estate and reappearing on upward scroll for easy access.

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to a wide range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Advanced Animations: The GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is utilized to deliver a fluid and natural-feeling scroll animation, offering a more refined experience than native browser capabilities.

Logical Information Flow: The website is structured to present a clear narrative, guiding the user from the problem statement to the proposed solution, its features, user testimonials, and a final call to action.

Technology Stack
This project was built using fundamental web technologies with a focus on a clean separation of concerns between structure, style, and behavior.

HTML5: Utilized for the semantic structure and content of the website.

CSS3: Employed for all styling, layout, and responsive design, incorporating modern features such as CSS Variables for efficient theme management.

JavaScript: Used to handle all user interactions, including the smooth scroll functionality and the dynamic navigation bar.

GSAP: A professional animation library implemented to create the high-quality smooth scrolling effect.

Adobe Fonts: Integrated to serve the "Gotham Narrow" typeface, ensuring brand consistency with the original design prototype.
